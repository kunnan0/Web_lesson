								<p>Hi guys I have got the O2 package and have really slow internet. A speed check online said I can get 3mbps but it seems more like 0.5 these days, just freezing and takking ages to open pages and open audio files for example. I have decided to switch to the UPC package which offers 10mbps but do you think I will get it ?</p>
